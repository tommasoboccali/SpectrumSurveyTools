It's based on ARC+ and integrates four HPCs from partner institutions in the collaboration with minimal extensions to our specific needs. We built it to enable access to data across institutes as we are not a CERN experiment and don't have any means of central authentication+ no VOMS or similar. We have had to rely on generating our own certificates+ and access to the batch queues through one central user with a robot certificate+ to which our users in turn are granted access through actual personal trust. There are however issues with local/national policy around who uses computing resources+ accesses data+ etc. There is also no way of securing local support at HPCs beyond good will+ as there is no guarantor organization for a MoU+ authentication+ etc+ and of course no real funding allocated for it+ for an experiment which is still in its design phase and doesn't count as an infrastructure (interestingly+ computing _is_ the only infrastructure for an experiment which so far only exists digitally). We are increasingly seeing refusal from new potential sites to either a) allocate the small effort needed to integrate into our system b) grant our researchers admin privileges on some machine to do the work c) host a machine that is paid for by research funds and managed entirely by the local researcher in question. All of this quoting security concerns which often come with a hint of international relations. \r\n\r\nI think there is a case for a virtual guarantor organisation playing a similar role as a host lab in the sense CERN does+ but in a truly international fashion. There is also a clash in how local HPCs think about their user base (the local research community+ with storage needs for a few years for a specific project) and how we operate (global community+ large (simulation) data sets that will outlive one or several storage disks and should ideally be backed up).", "My use case #1: Relevant links": "", "My use case #1: Uploaded Documentation": "", "Do you want to describe a second use case?": "No", "My use case #2: Description": "", "My use case #2: Relevant links": "", "My use case #2: Uploaded Documentation": "", "Do you want to describe a third use case?": "", "My use case #3: Description": "", "My use case #3: Relevant links": "", "My use case #3: Uploaded Documentation": "", "Do you agree to be contacted in case we have additional questions?": "Yes", "Which type(s) of resources does your e-Infrastructure provide today?": "HPC (CPU only); HTC CPU only (Grid-style+ batch+ ...)", "Please provide details": "", "Is the centre part of a larger e-infrastructure?": "No", "Which are the main mechanisms to get access to your infrastructure?": "Open only to some institutions' users", "Please quantify the size of your centre Number of CPU cores:Amount": "2000", "Please quantify the size of your centre Nukber of GPU boards:Amount": "", "Please quantify the size of your centre Installed disk (PB) - not including scratch disks on the nodes:Amount": "800TB", "Please quantify the size of your centre Installed tape (PB):Amount": "", "Please quantify the size of your centre Total Power used (including cooling) in MW:Amount": "", "Please quantify the size of your centre Total surface for IT resources in squared meters:Amount": "", "Please quantify the size of your centre (if applicable) Total number of deployable standard racks:Amount": "", "Do you operate special/login nodes?": "No", "Do you allow users to deploy services on login / edge nodes?": "No", "Resource allocation methods": "Via batch system (SLURM+ LSF+ PBS+ HTCondor+ ...); Other", "Which access patterns to the system you support?": "Batch queues (for example SLURM+ HTCondor+ PBS+ LSF+ \u2026)", "How long are typical resource allocations?

At the end of the days ours are codes that generates large matrices that represent particles and then diagonise such matrices in a \"smart\" (i.e. physics-motivated way) that will tell us about the properties of some physical objects and the causes of such properties.\r\n\r\nLanguages for this are by construction C(++) and Fortran+ because most other linear algebra routines of other languages are just wrappers for Lapack and boost. Computing FLOPs (and relative vectorisation and efficiency) are kings. Memory is necessary+ depending on the formalism and the case under consideration+ due to the size of the arrays could require 1GB per computing core or even more.\r\n\r\nRight now accelerators are starting to have enough memory-per-computing-core that could tackle many cases and formalisms. The main things holding us back to implement in accelerators right now is personell that understand the computational and software-engineering aspects of a scientific project and that can help with the development and implementation on new computing platform.
